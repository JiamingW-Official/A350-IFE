Oh, ooh ooh, hoo ooh ooh ooh
Angel baby, there is nothing I'd rather do
Think I love you, but I know that I will never do
Everything I love becomes everything I do

So, tell me anything, anything you want to
You're my darling girl, tell me what's on your mind
Tell me anything, anything you feel like, anything you feel like

Je comprends, je l'ai dit, c'est la vie
Oh Montréal, I pull apart, I don't mind
Running every red-light, you were right
Oh Montréal don't break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Ooh ooh, hoo ooh ooh ooh
Angel baby, you got me feeling kinda blue
Think I need you and you know the things that I would do
Everything I love is a consolation after you

So, tell me anything, anything you like to
You're my darling girl, tell me what's on your mind (what's on your mind)
Tell me anything, anything you feel like, anything you feel like

Je comprends, je l'ai dit, c'est la vie
Oh Montréal, I pull apart, I don't mind
Running every red-light, you were right
Oh Montréal don't break my heart
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you
I think I love you

Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh, oh
Ooh ooh ooh, oh
I don't need your medicine, gonna dance all night
I'm high on adrenaline, that's right, that's right, that's right
I don't need no medicine, gonna dance all night
I'm high on adrenaline, that's right, that's right, that's right

That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
That's right, that's right, that's right
