Big beats, black cloud
Get it wrong, get loud
Write a song, get down
And everyone will know
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Old man, get lost
Take his shit, maybe not
Listen good, he's got everything you know
And everyone should go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I don't need to know

Who do you want to?
Am I just right? Am I just right?
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Baby, it's perfect
You could be anything out there, anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air
Oh, no, it came

Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
What are you looking for in harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly whose wingspan is wide
On the way

Get caught up
Quit and sell life stock
Percolate, old body
Caught you moving slow
And everyone will know
And everyone can go

Big garden
And wish I could save them
Don't know, no plan
Everyone can go
And nobody can know
And nobody can know

I don't know need to know
So, do you want to?
Am I just, am I just?
Can you see the enemy just isn't me tonight?
Baby, it's perfect
You could be anything out there
Butterflies flying in the air

Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
What are you looking for in harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly whose wingspan is wide
To fly away

If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
Living in the real world
Looking for a dream girl

Uh-huh?
Oh, no, it came
Higher than an aeroplane
Don't know this song
Sweeter than a sugar cane
What are you looking for in harmony?
There is harmony in everything
It's a butterfly whose wingspan is wide
To fly away
If you're looking for a dream girl
I'll never be your dream girl
