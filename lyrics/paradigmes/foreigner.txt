Yesterday, you broke my heart
Before I was like your lover
But today I'm a foreigner
Yeah, yeah, I remember, it was together
Like a lover in the night, I'm looking back
And I don't know why now I'm a foreigner

But I'm a believer who's moving around like a wanderer
Between the shadows in the night I am looking back
Oh, I'm sorry baby, I'm giving to you a radio silence
'Cause I'm a lover baby, that's why I'm going up and down
I got a ticket for the love rollercoaster and now I'm falling down
You fuck this guy without a condom, a D.J or whatever
And I am sick of that, I got to moving around like a foreigner

Like a foreigner
Like a foreigner
Like a foreigner
Oh, yesterday we were together
You and me like dreamers
But now I'm like a foreigner
And I don't have the passport for your heart
Passport for your eyes

If you were a building or a country
I would have to visit that like a foreigner
Please come back to me 'cause I'm a believer
A soldier of love
Who's not looking back and you give me an hard time, lover
But please whenever, give me a visa for your heart
I want the stamps for the magic ride, in the mystery train of love
It's now or never 'cause as a foreigner I follow the road of my heart
I follow the road of my heart

Me and you
Me and you
Foreigner
Foreigner
Foreigner
Foreigner

Foreigner
